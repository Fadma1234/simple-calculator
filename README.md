This JavaScript project implements the client-side logic for a simple basic calculator capable of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. An event listener attached to a "Calculate" button triggers the core functionality, which first retrieves the two numeric inputs (num1, num2) and the selected mathematical operator from the HTML form elements. The script validates that the inputs are valid numbers using isNaN() and then employs a switch statement to perform the chosen mathematical operation, including a check to prevent division by zero. Finally, the calculated result (or an appropriate error message) is dynamically displayed on the webpage within a designated "result" element.
